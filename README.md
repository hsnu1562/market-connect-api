## environment settings:
please make sure you set up a new environment for this project, so it won't be mixed up with your default system environment.
to setup the environment, please follow the instructions in [Anaconda set up][Anaconda_set_up_link].

The following instructions of this README will assume you have already installed the resource packs.

[Anaconda_set_up_link]: ./instructions/Anaconda_setup.md

## how to test the API:
1.  make sure you are in the same directory as `main.py` (which should be `Market-Connect`) and run：
    `uvicorn main:app --reload`
    this command will start a local server on your device,
    you should see a message that says "Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)"

2.  go to any web browser, enter the link [127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

3.  you can now test out all the API routes. 
    for example: you want to test the function `/test-stalls`, simply find the function on the page, click it, then click "try it out", then click "execute".
    you should see the results below the "execute" button.
